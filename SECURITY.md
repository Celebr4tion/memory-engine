- Input validation and sanitization

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported through public GitHub issues as this could put users at risk.

### 2. Report privately

Send an email to: **security@memory-engine.org** (or if that's not available, contact the project maintainers directly)

Include the following information:
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the vulnerability

### 3. Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days - we'll assess the report and severity
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days for critical issues, 90 days for lower severity
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

### 4. Severity Classification

We use the following severity classification:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to admin
- Data exfiltration of all knowledge

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Significant data exposure
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication weaknesses
- Denial of service with permanent impact

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Limited data exposure
- Minor privilege escalation
- Input validation issues
- Temporary denial of service

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Information disclosure with minimal impact
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Issues requiring significant user interaction

## Security Best Practices for Users

When deploying Memory Engine, follow these security best practices:

### 🔧 Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
   ```bash
   # Use strong, unique secrets
   AUTH_SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-key>
   ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=<encryption-key>
   ```

2. **Database Security**: Secure your graph database and vector store
   - Use authentication for JanusGraph and Milvus
   - Enable encryption in transit
   - Regular security updates

3. **Network Security**: 
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Consider VPN for internal access

### 👥 User Management

1. **Strong Passwords**: Enforce password complexity requirements
2. **Role Assignment**: Follow principle of least privilege
3. **Regular Audits**: Review user accounts and permissions regularly
4. **Session Management**: Configure appropriate session timeouts

### 📋 Monitoring

1. **Audit Logs**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
2. **Security Monitoring**: Implement real-time security monitoring
3. **Backup Security**: Secure and encrypt backups
4. **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan

### 🔄 Updates

1. **Security Updates**: Apply security updates promptly
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Security Scanning**: Regular security scans of your deployment

## Security Testing

Memory Engine includes comprehensive security tests:

- **Authentication Tests**: 24 test cases covering user management and authentication
- **RBAC Tests**: 22 test cases for role-based access control
- **Encryption Tests**: 27 test cases for encryption and key management
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end security workflow testing

Run security tests:
```bash
# Run all security tests
pytest tests/test_security_*.py -v

# Run specific security module tests
pytest tests/test_security_auth.py -v
pytest tests/test_security_rbac.py -v
pytest tests/test_security_encryption.py -v
```

## Legal

### Responsible Disclosure

We request that security researchers:

1. **Act in good faith** to avoid privacy violations and service disruption
2. **Do not access or modify** user data without explicit permission
3. **Do not perform testing** on production systems without authorization
4. **Provide reasonable time** for fixes before public disclosure
5. **Make every effort** to avoid degradation of user experience

### Safe Harbor

When conducting security research according to this policy:

1. We will not pursue legal action against you
2. We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
3. We will acknowledge your responsible disclosure if you wish
4. We will not contact law enforcement about your research

This policy is inspired by responsible disclosure frameworks and follows industry best practices for open source security.
